The campaign begins on the Emerald Coast of the Earth Nation, an isolated region populated by scattered fishing villages. One such village, Kuilow Yu has been all but forgotten by the nation's leaders. Kuilow Yu is now threatened by various forces: pirates, bandits, and a mysterious group of masked warriors who attack and sabotage important village amenities.
